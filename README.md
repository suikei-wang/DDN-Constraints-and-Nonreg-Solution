# ddn-constraints-and-nonreg-solution
Some experiments of my research project on ddn

### Part 1: Semester 1, 2020: Multiple constraints

#### Multiple Equality Constraints
- more examples Done
- non-convex? In progress -> Non-regular solution
#### Multiple Inequality Constraints
- active / inactive constraints?
- null value in $$\lambda$$


### Part 2: Semester 2, 2020: Non-regular solutions
- Overdetermined system: Solving a least-square problem to minimize the residual $$r = Ax-b$$ .
- rank deficient (underdetermined): Preconditioning? - Approximate a matrix $$K \approx A$$
