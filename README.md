# ddn_constraints_and_nonreg_solution
Some experiments of my research project on ddn

### Part 1: Semester 1, 2020: Multiple constraints

#### Multiple Equality Constraints
- more examples
- non-convex?
#### Multiple Inequality Constraints
- active / inactive constraints?
- null value in $$\lambda$$



### Part 2: Semester 2, 2020: Non-regular solutions
